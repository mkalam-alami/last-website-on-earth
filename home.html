    <h3>August 2143, 12th</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Updated the Directory page, following the ruling on the <b>ostracism of station TEP-142</b>. The investigation concluded that after a trade dispute with TEP-291, its crew deliberately and in a premeditated manner harmed the hull of TEP-291 during the undocking maneuver. The ruling was approved, with a Yes vote of 85%. Station TEP-142 will be ostracized until August 2144.</li>
