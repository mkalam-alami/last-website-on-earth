    <h2>Unlocking your tablet due to failing upgrades</h2>
    <p>Because of the Downfall, the Teplin servers on Earth are all out of order, and your Teplin tablets will not be able to upgrade their system versions.</p>
    <p>A securiy in place makes the tablets lock themselves after spending 3 years without any upgrade patches. To resolve this, follow the procedure below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn off the tablet</li>
      <li>Hold down the top left and bottom right corners of the glass for about 20 seconds</li>
      <li>A "BIOS" screen will appear and ask for a "private key"</li>
      <li>Hover your glass over a screen <a href="guides-key.html">diplaying this key</a></li>
      <li>In the menu, rotate to the "Updates" nugget, pick it and unswipe any alerts</li>
      <li>Disable the automatic updates by unfilling the matching box</li>
      <li>Pick save and restart the tablet</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Taking good pictures of Earth</h2>
    <p>It is a widely encouraged hobby to take pictures of the Earth surface regularly and compare the results. This way, we can detect any possible break in the infamous "runaway greenhouse effect" that affects the atmosphere and triggered the Downfall.</p>
    <p>For best results, please take in account the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Suspend your station's rotation to make pictures less blurry</li>
      <li>Turn off all lights in the module from which you are taking pictures from (the dormitory is usually best, as the cockpit has a lot of annoying blinking lights)</li>
      <li>Clean the window you are taking the picture from</li>
      <li>Target land areas not covered by cloud structures</li>
      <li>Use the optical zoom to its maximum capacity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Do NOT take the tablets with you in EVA. They are not designed to work in outer space and will break immediately :)</p>
