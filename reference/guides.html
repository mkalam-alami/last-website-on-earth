    <h2>Unlocking your tablet due to failing upgrades</h2>
    <p>Because of the Downfall, the Teplin servers on Earth are all out of order, and your Teplin tablets will not be able to upgrade their system versions.</p>
    <p>A securiy in place makes the tablets lock themselves after spending 3 years without any upgrade patches. To resolve this, follow the procedure below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn off the tablet</li>
      <li>Hold down the top left and bottom right corners of the glass for about 20 seconds</li>
      <li>A "BIOS" screen will appear and ask for a "private key"</li>
      <li>Hover your glass over a screen <a href="guides-key.html">diplaying this key</a></li>
      <li>In the menu, rotate to the "Updates" nugget, pick it and unswipe any alerts</li>
      <li>Disable the automatic updates by unfilling the matching box</li>
      <li>Pick save and restart the tablet</li>
    </ul>
