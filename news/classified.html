    <h3>[August 25th, 7pm UTC] Crafting water filters from plants</h3>
    <p>Jeanine from TEP-117 will hold a radio course on frequency 1.808 Ghz. The purpose will be to share her research results on a possible solution to craft filters for the water recycling system, out of plant leaves. While still at the prototyping phase, a such solution would be an incredible breakthrough to help the quality of water in all stations, by ensuring new filters can be crafted out of renewable resources. It could eventually mean the end of our aging and increasingly toxic filters used since the launch of the stations.</p>

    <h3>[August 27th, 7pm UTC] Conference on the stations demographics</h3>
    <p>After the first conference got cancelled due to electrical issues on TEP-087, Louk√†s Karmanilos will finally hold his long-awaited presentation on the trends of demographics of man in space. He will address in particular the upcoming challenges that await, from the aging population to the increasing inbalance between women and men, as the latter are more often involved in lethal accidents due to lacking the discipline and mental strength to survive for now over 30 years.</p>
    
    <h3>[August 29th, 11am UTC] Concert by "The 421 Wizards"</h3>
    <p>The TEP-421 band will hold a live radio concert featuring a brand new tracklist. They will be joined by guest star singer Kaia from TEP-574.</p>
