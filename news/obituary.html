    <h1>[11 December 2088 - 4 August 2143] Millie Guillet</h1>
    <p>Millie Guillet born Millie Tamblin, crewmember of station TEP-316, has died a hero while defending the Farm Cloud from a terrorist attack by a rogue station. She went in EVA in order to stop an assaliant, himself in EVA and armed with a harpoon, from piercing the hull of her spacecraft.</p>
    <p>This heroic action is only one example of the strength and courage she has shown during her life in orbit. An engineering student back on Earth, she has shown remarkable skills to adapt to her new life in orbit. She is known as the first person to have succeeded in giving birth and raising a child in orbit. But we should not forget her great knowledge of life support systems, which has helped maintain dozens of stations in operating conditions. She never missed a chance to share her knowledge and wisdom to the people she met. </p>
    <p>She will be survived by her husband Nicolas (TEP-316) and her child Emmanuel (TEP-489), as well as fellow crewmembers Alan, Juanita and Dennis.</p>
    
    <h1>[c. 2095 - 23 July 2143] Ronald</h1>
    <p>Ronald, crewmember of station TEP-474, died of sickness after food poisoning from rotten vegetables.</p>
    <p>He was a quiet person with a great passion for Japanese animation. He is known for allegedly bringing into orbit a hard drive full of cartoons and movies, only to lose it by accident by forgetting it in a transfer airlock.</p>
    <p>He will be survived by fellow crewmembers Mei, Dev, Leela and Jeanne.</p>
